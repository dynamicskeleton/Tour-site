      El Matador Beach is one of three beaches within Robert H. Meyer Memorial
      State Beach. El Matador is the most popular of the three and the closest
      to Malibu. The parking lots for each beach are well-signed along Pacific
      Coast Highway in western Malibu. El Matador has a parking lot on the bluff
      with picnic tables that look out over the Pacific Ocean. A trail descends
      through unique eroding formations on the face of the bluff then stairs
      take you the rest of the way to the beach.
